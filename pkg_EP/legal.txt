The Lunar-Lagrange Alliance names are based on wikipedia's lists of most popular given names and surnames, released under CC-BY-SA 3.0 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License)

The Autonomist names are just ones I made up that sound cool. Though, I'm sure there's some other characters out there called "Void" or "Oberon."
